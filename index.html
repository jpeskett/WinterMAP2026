Key Findings
	•	58% of non-growing students PASSED our internal Alpha tests at 90%+ — this is the single most alarming signal. It means our tests give false confidence about student readiness.
	•	45 students (23%) never even took a mastery exam — they are stuck in the pipeline, enrolled in courses but never reaching the assessment gate.
	•	37 students (19%) tried the test but couldn't pass — the curriculum isn't teaching what the test measures, or students are being tested at the wrong level.
	•	Alpha School Austin dominates Bucket 2 with 25 of 45 students — a campus-specific efficiency problem.
	•	Average growth across all 196 students is ~1.05x — essentially flat, barely above typical growth, and far below the 2x target.
	•	Deep dive students (Lydia Cobas, George Troxell, Elle Zak, Lucius Walker) are all in Bucket 3, confirming the systemic pattern.
Bottom Line for Leadership
196 students failed to reach 2x growth. The data reveals a systemic crisis: 57 students were trapped in doom loops, taking the same test 4+ times while cycling through ineffective content.
	•	Bucket 1 (19%, 37 students) — Curriculum Not Effective: Curriculum doesn't teach what tests measure. Fix: Adopt Direct Instruction curriculum, audit TEKS coverage, ensure 25 min/day on-task time.
	•	Bucket 2 (23%, 45 students) — Curriculum Not Efficient: Students enrolled but never reach the test. Fix: Implement pacing alerts, enforce semester-based completion SLAs, flag supplementary-only enrollments.
	•	Bucket 3a (29%, 57 students) — Tests Not Rigorous Enough: Passed Alpha at 90%+ in 3 or fewer attempts but didn't grow 2x on MAP. Fix: Upgrade K-2 test rigor, add MAP-aligned validation layer for Grade 3+.
	•	Bucket 3b (29%, 57 students) — Doom Loop Crisis: Took 4+ attempts on the same test, cycling through Freckle/Edia with undiagnosed gaps. 47% have HM ≤ 2 (fluency issues). Fix: Deploy doom loop detection, diagnostic-first intervention, replace with Direct Instruction for foundational gaps.
The immediate priority: Detect and interrupt doom loops. Then systematically replace low-effectiveness tools and enforce fluency prerequisites. The path forward is not more testing; it's smarter systems, earlier alerts, and deliberate intervention on the patterns that derail growth.
